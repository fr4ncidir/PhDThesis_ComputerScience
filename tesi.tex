\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
\headletter{S}
emantic Driven Agent Programming idea joins together concepts that are relatively well-known in literature. Agent programming, as it will be discussed, dates back to the early 90's \cite{shoham1993agent}, while the Semantic Web was introduced by Tim Berners Lee in 2001~\cite{berners2001semantic}. The innovation proposed by this Thesis, therefore, is not given by those concepts taken on their own, but is rather the outcome of their integration into several ideas and projects, which are going to be explored in the following Chapters. 

The effort made to define such collaboration targets the third pole of interest of the Thesis, namely the Internet of Things (IoT) \cite{ashton2009internet}. As a matter of fact, the IoT represents one of the most outstanding global creativity sources of the last century. With the advent of affordable computing, pervasive electronics and the Internet, technology started to follow a quick and exponential growth trend that today incredibly changed our society~\cite{gubbi2013internet}. Moreover, technology became part of the life of almost everyone as a service provider. Alongside with this revolution, the growth trend involved also an easier access to the tools needed to create new things and to put into practice new ideas, giving birth to \textit{maker} movement \cite{dougherty2012maker, martin2015promise}. Anyone, with some know-how in electronics and informatics, can try to implement his/her own projects, share it to the community and, eventually, also make money with it \cite{abbasy2017predictable, lensing2018designing}.

All this, with a continuous feedback process to and from the industry and the academy, resulted in a worldwide productivity that still benefits almost every technological field. 

Over the time, however, it became clear that this race to innovation was extremely chaotic \cite{farhan2018concise}. In fact, projects were designed in a vertical way from the beginning to the end, and the problem of joining any two of them was often the same as restarting both of them from scratch in a single one performing both tasks \cite{al2015toward}.

The present work tries to fight with this verticality enabling the IoT to use the tools of the Semantic Web. Ontologies, in the semantic interpretation of the term, represent a great opportunity to provide a common discussion pattern among vertical projects \cite{shadbolt2006semantic}. In particular, two ontologies will be provided here in the following Chapters.

The former, in Section~\ref{sec:iomust}, is the Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) \ontoref{iomust} ontology. The discussion over this ontology will allow us to introduce a full set of concepts and ideas related to an horizontal approach to IoT. Besides, the musical IoT application represents an innovative application in the whole research field.

The latter, in Chapter~\ref{ch:semantic_wot}, is the Semantic Web of Things (SWOT) ontology~\ontoref{swot}. Such ontology is located at a higher level compared to the previous one. As a matter of fact, in this case we target a newer approach to IoT that treats the pervasive electronics resources as web resources and renames IoT as Web of Things (WoT) \cite{guinard2011internet, zeng2011web}. The innovation proposed here is the addition of semantics to further prevent the formation of fragmented entities.

 
%The main innovative effort, in any case, is the one that tries to identify a connection, or a possible common interpretation between contents that seem to be far away from each other. For instance, this work will try to find such connection between the Semantic Web, the concept of ontology, the Internet of Things and its applications. The goal, eventually, is to suggest a possible way of transforming them into something that globally would benefit all the aforementioned fields at once in a great collaboration scheme.
%, and in particular one of the most outstanding generators of global creativity of the last century: the Internet of Things.

%In the Sections that follow, we will go through the Thesis title, exploring and exploiting the ideas that build the compound. The first concept indeed is the Semantic Web. It will represent, across the Thesis, the main tool allowing the successful collaboration of the others. 

Applying the Semantic Web technologies to the IoT and the WoT by the means of an ontology will give a predefined shared way to set up projects at information and organization level. For instance, in IoT systems there is often a lack of coherence about the definition of the \textit{thing}, which is a core concept that guarantees interoperability. A standardized approach for concept interpretation would definitely help in building or integrating software and data architecture. In their interesting survey, Liu et al.~\cite{liu2016comparison} listed a number of different possible definitions for the \textit{thing}. The two most relevant among them, for this Thesis, are W3C's and IEEE's hereby reported for reader's convenience.
\begin{description}
\item[IEEE] [The thing] \textit{is any physical object relevant from a user or application perspective.}

\item[W3C] [The things] \textit{can be virtual representations of a physical or abstract entities. They can be connected or not connected. Each thing can have one or more virtual representations. Things can have histories, and have identities, rich descriptions, services, access control and data handling policies. They have URIs.}
\end{description}

Both those definitions make clear reference to the fact that the \textit{things} are not static elements in an application, but instead are interactive factors of change. They are either active or passive in their environment, and consequently contribute to modify the application context. For this reason, as the term \textit{thing} is rather confusing and yet not far from a philosophical concept, in this Thesis we will refer to it with a different word, i.e. \textit{agent}, unless otherwise stated. Such lexical change is derived from the comparison between the two definitions above and the aforementioned paper by Shoham \cite{shoham1993agent}. Some other works, like Mzahm et al.~\cite{mzahm2014enhancing} and Savaglio et al.~\cite{savaglio2017agent} also go in that same direction. In particular, we refer to the agent as an entity that has access to context information, which the Semantic Web is able to realize through its concept interconnection expressivity.

We will discuss how those agents moving and interacting in the semantic architecture can be programmed and, even better, how they can provide us as much services as possible, with the lesser effort. Globally, as a result, this work contains a set of propositions that target an integration of the Semantic Web in the IoT towards new working, plug-and-play and fully integrated solutions. 

Consequently, the outcome of this study is a complete description of why and how we should put some order in the IoT as it is known today, as well as decide a shared approach to perform this task. It is worth noticing, moreover, that a common way to think about and use the IoT like the one suggested here may enable new opportunities  also in other related fields of ICT, like the one connected to the Big Data revolution \cite{mcafee2012big}.

%Big Data, in fact, represents a collection of information having all the possible undesirable features: (i) it is huge; (ii) it does not follow a predefined schema; (iii) it is very hard to check correctness; (iv) it refers to a variety of topics that can be compared only with the variety available in the global World Wide Web and the variety of the whole IoT together. Even more, the IoT is continuously feeding the Big Data with new information. This factor brought academy and industry to suggest the development of the so called Edge (or Fog) Computing: the amount of raw data released is reduced, while IoT is required to produce more intermediate middle-to-high-level information. Devices, in the Edge Computing paradigm, perform raw data check and elaboration on board as much as possible close to the physical world. Services, on the other hand, benefit from this because of simpler code, less storage space, easier integration.

%Once we join the contents listed above, the vision eventually starts to become clearer. 
%Within this Thesis, in Chapter~\ref{ch:background}, we will provide more details on the Semantic Web (Section~\ref{sec:semantic_web}) and on the concept of Semantic Event (Section~\ref{sec:sepa}).
The Thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter~\ref{ch:background} the research background of the whole work will be explained over its complete state-of-the-art. For instance, the IoT evolution is there summarized, along with a view on the protocols and the challenges that originated from it. Then the Semantic Web will be introduced and, eventually, the hardware-software architectures that have been developed to use it overcoming its limitations. A research on how to visualize semantic graphs is also included, which we performed with didactic purposes.

Chapter~\ref{ch:iot}, then, will provide a semantic layered view of the IoT by means of the ideas outlined in Chapter~\ref{ch:background}. The Internet of Musical Things ontology is there fully explained, leveraging general concepts that may be useful to grant horizontal interoperability among various IoT systems within different environments and backgrounds.

Chapter~\ref{ch:semantic_wot}, instead, includes the basic concepts needed to start talking about semantic IoT, and extends the discussion to the WoT. It contains, therefore, the description of the Semantic Web of Things Ontology: it compares the approach with the pre-existent works made by W3C, and following this it proceeds with a semantic description of \textit{semantic} Web Things \textit{dynamic semantic} interaction.

Following the theoretical views, we provide in Chapter~\ref{ch:semantic_agent} a rather complete evaluation of the ontology. To do so, we show the functionality of a Python framework to use the classes and the relationships previously introduced on a simple example, yet rich in interesting insights. Then, the ontology itself is considered as a whole for evaluation, leading us to ideas for future works to achieve additional results.

Eventually, we make a synthesis and conclude the Thesis.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}  
\headletter{A}
cross the Chapters of this Thesis a variety of topics were discussed. First of all, we introduced the great Internet of Things revolution, that created in the last twenty years an outstanding opportunity for industry and academy to reach exceptional results. The IoT is now part of everyday life, and its effects on society can only increase in the next years.

A large discussion was then presented reporting the greatest drawback of IoT, i.e., its fragmentation. Also known as ``vertical silos'' fragmentation, this IoT design nightmare is substantially hindering the development of integrated systems due to the difficulty of sharing resource and data among entities that were developed at different time, with different goals, and by different programmers. The various abstraction layers that compose IoT applications need a common way to interact safely and effectively.

The term \textit{interaction}, in this Thesis, is usually intended as \textit{sharing information}. The Semantic Web stack was designed to provide the suitable tools capable of realizing this shared data community. That is, systems would use and design internally their own proprietary data representation, but still agree on a common way to intend resources and relationships on a higher interactive level. Consequently, the Semantic Web could represent a powerful tool to fight IoT fragmentation.

Keeping this idea in mind, we presented some applications related to the Semantic Web: a study on how to visualize it, for diagnostic and didactic purposes; an integration of multiple information sources, within the AudioCommons European project; the SPARQL Event Protocol Architecture, that is the core of the work pursued in the PhD.

The effort of creating a common playground for a fully interoperable IoT through Semantic technologies and protocols led us also to the design and the evaluation of the Internet of Musical Things Ontology. This is a major contribution of the Thesis, as we provide a large description of a shared vocabulary in an innovative and previously mostly unexplored field of the IoT. For the future, we expect to further extend step-by-step the ontology to integrate further IoT application domains in the same description.

Eventually, the Thesis outlines the possibility to realize an implementation of the Web of Things in a semantic fashion. By exploiting the SEPA, in particular, the work here presented shows that the semantic representation of information is capable to keep up with the dynamic evolution of an IoT environment. Consequently, a study is provided on how the Things and their active and passive interactions could be ontologically represented. 

We designed and evaluated, therefore, the Semantic Web of Things Ontology and a framework that realizes the interaction mechanisms over our SEPA architecture. Both the framework and the ontology are an important contribution within the Thesis, and are freely available on Github. This work also led to a publication on the Journal with the highest Impact Factor in the IoT research field (IEEE IoT Journal). Their usage is expected to provide interesting results in future research, for instance by extending the Internet of Musical Things towards the Semantic Web Of Musical Things, as well as enhancing the descriptive capabilities with reasoning mechanisms, or integrating the context with the knowledge of semantic endpoints like DBpedia.

\textbf{IoMusT ontology} & The author of this Thesis realized the ontology engineering work for the IoMusT journal publication (still under revision as for \today). That is, the various sub-components of the ontology were studied to realize the overall integration and functionalities (Section~\ref{ssec:description}). The evaluation part (Section~\ref{ssec:iomust_evaluation}) is also an achievement of the work pursued by the author in this Thesis, given the fact that there is not a standard evaluation mechanism for ontologies. Not to mention, the full \texttt{.owl} file realization through Protégé, and the provided online documentation. \\

\textbf{SWOT ontology} & The contribution of the author of this Thesis in the SWOT ontology spans over all the steps described in the previous Chapters~\ref{ch:semantic_wot} and \ref{ch:semantic_agent}. In particular, the complete analysis of the work made by the W3C, including the Thing Description conceptualization and the data representation were refactored keeping in mind the SEPA. The ontology, its \texttt{.owl} description, its documentation and the paper published at IEEE IoT Journal \cite{antoniazzi2019building} are the main achievements to be reported here.\\

\textbf{Visualization of \mbox{Semantic} Knowledge Bases} & Working with ontologies both at teaching level and at a research level outlined over the time in ARCES research group the need for tools that would help us in explaining the contents of ontologies and Knowledge Bases. The achievements reached in this field by the author are in one hand a survey over the tools already available \cite{antoniazzi2018rdf} and, in the other hand, the collaboration in the realization of another tool specific for teaching purposes, named Tarsier \cite{viola2018interactive}. This work was helpful to study and prepare the SWOT ontology and the IoMusT ontology.\\
